# Specification: AICoder - Multi-Model Support Expansion

## Overview
Rebrand the application to "AICoder" and expand support to include three AI coding assistants: OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini CLI, and Anthropic's Claude Code. The application will ensure these tools are correctly installed at startup and provide a unified interface to configure and launch each one.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Full Rebranding to "AICoder"
- Update application display name in UI (Window Title, About dialog).
- Rename build artifacts and executable to `AICoder`.
- Update internal project identifiers, bundle IDs (macOS), and application metadata.

### 2. Startup Installation & Verification
- **Installation Window:** Display a progress window during startup.
- **Verification Steps:**
    - Check if `codex`, `gemini` (CLI), and `claude-code` are installed (PATH check).
    - Verify versions meet minimum requirements.
    - **Auto-Installation:** If a tool is missing or outdated, attempt to install it automatically (e.g., via `npm` or `go` as appropriate).
- **Blocking Progress:** Startup only continues if tools are verified or successfully installed/updated.

### 3. Unified Tabbed Interface (Vertical Sidebar)
- Implement a sidebar on the left for navigation between three tabs: **Codex**, **Gemini**, and **Claude Code**.
- Each tab must provide:
    - **Model Settings:** Configuration for API Keys and Base URLs.
    - **Model Switching:** Ability to switch between different service providers/endpoints for the same tool.
    - **Launch Action:** A button to trigger the execution of the respective CLI tool with the current configuration.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Consistency:** Maintain a uniform layout and styling across all three tabs.
- **Robustness:** Gracefully handle installation failures with clear user guidance.
- **Platform Support:** Ensure installation logic works across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application title is "AICoder" and executable is named accordingly.
- [ ] Startup window correctly detects missing tools and attempts installation.
- [ ] Sidebar navigation allows switching between tool configurations.
- [ ] Changes to API Key/URL in one tab are persisted and used when launching that specific tool.
- [ ] All three tools can be launched from their respective tabs.

## Out of Scope
- Integration with other AI models not mentioned (Codex, Gemini, Claude).
- Direct terminal emulation within the GUI (launches external terminal as per existing pattern).
